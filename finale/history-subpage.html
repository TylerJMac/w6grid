        <h2>History:</h2>
        <p2>Christmas on Comstock may be a popular holiday tradition for many families, while also functioning as an effective fundraiser for the Make-A-Wish foundation, but it had humble beginnings. At first, it was just the McNamara family decorating their house and programming the lights to music for the fun of it. But once they moved, they approached all of their neighbors and gave them all a heads up that they do this feature for the Christmas season. After 2 years of the McNamara house setting up animated Christmas lights, three other neighbors who lived adjacent from them approached the father of the McNamara family and asked if he could also animate their lights. One thing led to another, and then one side of the entire street was decorated, then it led to all 13 houses on both sides of the street all dancing to Christmas music. All of these families work together to this day to provide entertainment and joy to visitors new and returning, all the while raising money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.</p2>
