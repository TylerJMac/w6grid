        General Information:
This site aims to inform guests interested in the yearly Christmas light event, Christmas on Comstock. We want to spread the reason for the season with as many people as we can reach, along with helping children afflicted with disease by raising money for the Make-A-Wish foundation. We have a dedicated radio station that plays the music the light show is animated to on 99.5. Thank you for stopping by this website, and any questions you may have could be answered on the other pages this site has to offer.
<p>
<p>
Traffic Rules and Consideration for Others:
 Since the light show is a staple event for most citizens of the Gilbert area, there is a large amount of traffic that comes down Comstock. There are two types of traffic: foot traffic, where people can be up close and listen to the lights while walking down the street, and street traffic, where people can stay inside their cars, tune in to the show through our radio station, and watch the entire light show. There is a significant amount of street traffic, especially on weekends, so we ask all of our guests to respect traffic cones, signs and other peoples streets in order to keep a safe environment.

      <h3>History of Christmas on Comstock</h3>
      <p>
        History: Christmas on Comstock may be a popular holiday tradition for many families, while also functioning as an effective fundraiser for the Make-A-Wish foundation, but it had humble beginnings. At first, it was just the McNamara family decorating their house and programming the lights to music for the fun of it. But once they moved, they approached all of their neighbors and gave them all a heads up that they do this feature for the Christmas season. After 2 years of the McNamara house setting up animated Christmas lights, three other neighbors who lived adjacent from them approached the father of the McNamara family and asked if he could also animate their lights. One thing led to another, and then one side of the entire street was decorated, then it led to all 13 houses on both sides of the street all dancing to Christmas music. All of these families work together to this day to provide entertainment and joy to visitors new and returning, all the while raising money for the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
<p>
  Make-A-Wish Foundation: Christmas on Comstock began its partnership with the Make-A-Wish foundation in 2009.There is a donation box in front of the McNamara’s house, and 100% of all donations go to Make-A-Wish. Since Comstock started this fundraiser for Make-A-Wish back in 2009, they have granted 22 wishes to children with different types of cancer.

      <h3>Accomplishments and Popular Visiting Times</h3>
      <p>
        Comstocks Accomplishments: A couple of years into the streetwide Christmas light show, a reality television show named “The Great Christmas Light Fight'' that works with ABC approached the street and asked if they would be interested in participating in a competition for a neighborhood special that pits Christmas on Comstock against two other neighborhoods. The residents of Comstock agreed, and had to set up their light display in August in order for the camera crew to have enough time to film and put the episode together. After weeks of waiting, the celebrity judge of the show, Carter Oosterhouse, announced that Comstock had won the competition and earned 50,000 dollars and trophies for all thirteen houses. This was a huge honor, and 2015 was our busiest year. In addition, multiple news channels come out during Christmas time to do a report on Christmas on Comstock. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Dates and popular times: The Christmas on Comstock team gets hard to work as soon as Thanksgiving is over in order to complete the light show before December 1st. December 1st is the opening day for the public with the final day of the light show being New Years Day. Our busiest days are the first couple of days in December, weekends, and the week leading up to Christmas. It is advised to come on a weekday, but there is a much more lively environment on the weekends, so the options are up to you, the reader.
