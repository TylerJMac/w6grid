        <h2>General Information:</h2>
        <p2>
            This site aims to inform guests interested in the yearly Christmas light event, Christmas on Comstock. We want to spread the reason for the season with as many people as we can reach, along with helping children afflicted with disease by raising money for the Make-A-Wish foundation. We have a dedicated radio station that plays the music the light show is animated to on 99.5. Thank you for stopping by this website, and any questions you may have could be answered on the other pages this site has to offer.</p2>

        <h2>Traffic Rules and Consideration for Others:</h2>
        <p2>
            Since the light show is a staple event for most citizens of the Gilbert area, there is a large amount of traffic that comes down Comstock. There are two types of traffic: foot traffic, where people can be up close and listen to the lights while walking down the street, and street traffic, where people can stay inside their cars, tune in to the show through our radio station, and watch the entire light show. There is a significant amount of street traffic, especially on weekends, so we ask all of our guests to respect traffic cones, signs and other peoples streets in order to keep a safe environment.</p2>
