        <h2>Comstock Accomplishments:</h2>
        <p2>A couple of years into the streetwide Christmas light show, a reality television show named â€œThe Great Christmas Light Fight'' that works with ABC approached the street and asked if they would be interested in participating in a competition for a neighborhood special that pits Christmas on Comstock against two other neighborhoods. The residents of Comstock agreed, and had to set up their light display in August in order for the camera crew to have enough time to film and put the episode together. After weeks of waiting, the celebrity judge of the show, Carter Oosterhouse, announced that Comstock had won the competition and earned 50,000 dollars and trophies for all thirteen houses. This was a huge honor, and 2015 was our busiest year. In addition, multiple news channels come out during Christmas time to do a report on Christmas on Comstock. </p2>

        <h2>Dates and popular times:</h2>
        <p2>The Christmas on Comstock team gets hard to work as soon as Thanksgiving is over in order to complete the light show before December 1st. December 1st is the opening day for the public with the final day of the light show being New Years Day. Our busiest days are the first couple of days in December, weekends, and the week leading up to Christmas. It is advised to come on a weekday, but there is a much more lively environment on the weekends, so the options are up to you, the reader.</p2>
